# home-server
Contains the docker compose files and sample env files for my home server setup.

## Installation
This is how I setup these files
1. Make the directories: /srv/compose & mkdir /srv/data & mkdir /srv/ext
2. Clone the repo into compose: cd /srv/compose & git clone url .
3. Fill in the .env.sample files and rename them to .env
4. Run the docker containers!
